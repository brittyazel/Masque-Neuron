# Masque-Neuron
The default Neuron skin for the Masque World of Warcraft addon.

This add-on skin is meant to compliment the Neuron action bar addon, and is mostly what Soyier likes his buttons to look like.


#### Masque:
This addon requires Masque in order to function. Soyier has no part in the development of Masque, but is thankful to StormFX for his work on Masque over the years.

##### Credits:
This addon was inspired by Masque: Renaitre "Beveled", though is only meant to be an inspiration of that style, not a recreation.
