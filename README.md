# Masque: Neuron

This is the default Neuron skin for the Masque World of Warcraft add-on. It is updated for Masque 9.0+

This add-on skin is meant to compliment the Neuron action bar add-on, and is mostly just a simple implementation of what Soyier prefers his buttons to look like. It features a rounded square design with a dark bloom effect in the middle. The idea with this theme was to be **simple**, **tasteful**, and **elegant**.

## Masque:

This add-on requires Masque in order to function. Soyier has no part in the development of Masque, but is thankful to StormFX for his work on Masque over the years.

## Credits:

This add-on was inspired by Masque: Renaitre "Beveled", though is only meant to be an inspiration of that style, not a recreation.
